# XRD_Cif_Converter

This program searches for all .cif - files in the choosen directory. All important parameters that need to be meantioned in publications will be extracted, formated and saved in a new file. 

One can choose, if the new files shall be saved in the same directory as the original .cif-file, or if they shall be saved together in a given, new directory.

Additionaly, the program will generate a file.log, which logs all the found cif-files, and a error.log, which logs any cif-file with missing parameters.

Feel free to contact me in case of any questions.
